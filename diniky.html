<body> People's quotations
<ul>
  <li> <q> Learn truth from facts </q>  </li>
  <li> <q> Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they innate in mind? No. They come from social practice and from it alone. 
  They come from three kinds of social practice: the struggle for production, the class struggle and scientific experiment</q> (Mao Zedong) </li>
  <li> </q> The primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means
the positive integers</q> (Erret Bishop) </li>
  <li> <q>If God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done, let
him do it himself</q> (Erret Bishop) </li>
</ul> <br>

<p> <em> Criterium for truth.</em> <q>  Then comes the second stage in the process of cognition, the stage leading from consciousness back to matter, 
  from ideas back to existence, 
  in which the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in social practice to ascertain whether the theories, 
  policies, plans or measures meet with the anticipated success. Generally speaking, <em>those that succeed are correct 
  and those that fail are incorrect</em>, and this is especially true of man’s struggle with nature </q>.
  Furthermore, <q> Man’s knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice. 
  This leap is more important than the previous one.
  For it is this leap alone that can prove the correctness or incorrectness of the first leap in cognition, 
  i.e., of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures formulated in the course of reflecting the objective external world. 
  <em>There is no other way of testing truth</em>.</q> (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_01.htm"> marxist.org</a>)

  This view constrast drastically to what some philosophers defend. Take Spinoza, according to whom <q> truth is its own measure</q>, that is possessing the truth is fully enough to be ascertain of its correcteness.
  Such truth, he said in his ethics, is reflected by such ideas as the the idea that the sum of the angles on triangle is equal two rights. First, nowadays we know this is no longer
  true in general since on spaces with positive curvature, the angles add up stricly greater than two rights, first point. The second point is that, Spinoza implicitly 
  defend the existence of some absolute reality that is not changing with times, for example those ideas that he consider from God, i.e. true and eternal. Where are those ideas?
  Spinoza replies, those are the true ideas! How to find true ideas? In God. In Nature. Spinoza was able to get rid of the anthropomorphic God, yet he did not push his ideas further by 
  defeating totally idealism and embracing fully materialism. But, that is quite making sense since he lived in a era that was still under strong domination by Religions.<br>

  So, the truth of  ideas, theories, plans, policies can only be known through the test of the practice, and by it alone (<em> Praxis </em>.) It can be applied to mathematics.
  What is the practical reality of mathematics? The practical reality of mathematics is \( \mathbb{N} \) that we can extend up to \( \mathbb{R}\) mathematicians still
  strugle to understand. All mathematical theories should be tested through the lens of natural integers! This is why constructive mathemtics is the correct framework of doing mathemtics
 because the existence of mathematical objects should be certified by the practical mathematical reality embodied by the natural integers, that is any mathematical theory
  should admit at most countably many routines to check its truth. This is more and more relevant nowadays as we move to computer prgramming era in almost all fields of research.
