<body> People's quotations
<ul>
  <li> <q> Learn truth from facts </q>  </li>
  <li> <q> Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they innate in mind? No. They come from social practice and from it alone. 
  They come from three kinds of social practice: the struggle for production, the class struggle and scientific experiment</q> (Mao Zedong) </li>
  <li> </q> The primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means
the positive integers</q> (Erret Bishop) </li>
  <li> <q>If God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done, let
him do it himself</q> (Erret Bishop) </li>
</ul> <br>

<p> <em> Criteriu of truth.</em> <q>  Then comes the second stage in the process of cognition, the stage leading from consciousness back to matter, 
  from ideas back to existence, 
  in which the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in social practice to ascertain whether the theories, 
  policies, plans or measures meet with the anticipated success. Generally speaking, <em>those that succeed are correct 
  and those that fail are incorrect</em>, and this is especially true of man’s struggle with nature </q>.
  Furthermore, <q> Man’s knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice. 
  This leap is more important than the previous one.
  For it is this leap alone that can prove the correctness or incorrectness of the first leap in cognition, 
  i.e., of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures formulated in the course of reflecting the objective external world. 
  <em>There is no other way of testing truth</em>.</q> (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_01.htm"> marxist.org</a>)
