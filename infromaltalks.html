	</ul> <br>
	<p> <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16842055/IAF.pdf"> Here </a> is a textbook from Cedric Villani. One of the most inspiring textbook I have ever found
	
		in the field of measure and integration (though it is written in french.)
		To be recommended together with the excellent book from Edwin Hewitt and Karl Stromberg, Real and abstract analysis. </p><br>
	<p>For topology book, Beginner's Course in Topology by Fuks and V.A. Rokhlin is much appreciated for its original insight of <q> elementary toplogy</q> and its non-conventional style. </p>
