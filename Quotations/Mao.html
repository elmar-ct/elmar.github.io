	<h2> Quotations from Mao Zedong </h2>
	<p>  Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from skies? No. Are they innate in mind? No. They come from social practice and from it alone;
  they come from three kinds of social practice, the struggle for production, the class struggle, and scientific experiment. </p> <br>
    
   <p> It is man’s social being that determines his thinking. </p> <br>
    
   <p> Man’s knowledge depends mainly on his activity in material production, through which he comes gradually to understand the phenomena, the properties and the laws of nature, and the relations 
     between himself and nature; and through his activity in production also gradually comes to understand, 
     in varying degrees, certain relations that exist between man and man </p><br>
    <p> In class society everyone lives as a member of a particular class, and every kind of thinking, without exception, 
      is stamped with the brand of a class. </p> <br>

    <p> Marxists hold that in human society activity in production develops
step by step from a lower to a higher level and that consequently man’s knowledge, whether of nature or of society, 
      also develops step by step from a lower to a higher level, that is, from the shallower to the deeper, from the one-sided to the many-sided </p>
