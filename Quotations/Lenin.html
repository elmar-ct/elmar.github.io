	<h2> Quotations from Vladimir Ilich Lenin </h2>
	<p>  The state arises where, when and insofar as class antagonism objectively cannot be reconciled. And
conversely, the existence of the state proves that the class antagonisms are irreconcilable.(V.I.Lenin, State and Revolution)</p> <br>
    
    
   <p> The proletariat will use its supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to 
     centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the 
     ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.(V.I.Lenin, State and Revolution) </p><br>

<p> The principal and primary function of banks is to serve as an intermediary in the making of payments. In doing so they transform inactive money capital into active capital, that is, into capital
producing a profit; they collect all kinds of money revenues and place them at the disposal of the capitalist class.(Imperialism, the Highest stage of Capitalism) </p>
