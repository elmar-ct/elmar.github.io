	<h2> Dawn of Space </h2>

    <p> Our Euclidean intuition, probably inherited from ancient primates, might
have grown out of the first seeds of geometry in the motor control 
systems of early animals who were brought up to sea and then to land by the Cambrian explosion half a billion years ago. The primates' brain had been
idling for 30-40 million years. Suddenly, in a flash of one million years, it exploded into growth under the relentless pressure of sexual-social  competition and sprouted a massive neocortex (70% neurons in humans) with an
inexplicable capability for language, sequential reasoning and generation of
mathematical ideas. Then Man came and laid down space on papyrus in a string of axioms, lemmas and theorems around 300 B.C. in Alexandria.  </p>

    <p> Projected to words, the brain's model of space began to evolve by 
dropping, modifying and generalizing its axioms. The Parallel Postulate fell
first: Gauss, Schweikart, Lobachevski,1 Bolyai (who else?) came to the
conclusion that there is a unique non-trivial one-parameter deformation of
the metric on \(\R^3\) keeping the space fully homogeneous. </p>


	<p> It is believed, that Gauss, who convinced himself of the validity of 
hyperbolic geometry somewhere between 1808 and 1818, was disconcerted by
the absence of a Euclidean realization of the hyperbolic plane \(H^2\). By that
time, he must have had a clear picture of the geometry of surfaces in \(\R^3\) (exposed in his 
		<q><em>Disquisitones circa superficies curvas</em></q> in \(1827\)), where the
(intrinsic) distance between two points on a surface is defined as the length of the shortest (better to say <q>innmal</q>) curve in the surface between these
points. (This idea must have been imprinted by Nature in the brain, as
most animals routinely choose shortest cuts on rugged terrains.) Gauss discovered the following powerful and efficient criterion for isometry between
surfaces, distinguishing, for example, a piece of a round sphere \(S^2\subset \R^3\) from an arbitrarily bent sheet of paper (retaining its intrinsic Euclideanness
under bendings). </p>

<p> Map a surface \(S\subset \R^3\) to the unit sphere \(S^2\) by taking the vectors \(\nu (s) \in S\) parallel to the unit normal vector 
		vectors \(v(s)\), \(s\in S\). If \(S\) is \(C^2\)-smooth, the Gauss map \(G: S\to S^2\,, s\mapsto \nu(s)\) is \(C^1\) and its Jacobian, i.e. <em> the infinitesimal
		area distorsion</em>, comes with a non-ambiguous sign [...] and so \(S\) appears with a real function, called Gauss curvature \(\Kappa(s) = \operatorname{det}(G)(s) \). </p>

		<h3>  Theorem Egregium</h3>

		<p> Every isometry between surfaces, say \(f: S \to S_1\), preserves Gauss curvature, \(\Kappa(f(s_1)) = \Kappa(s_1)\) for all \(s_1\in S_1\). </p>
