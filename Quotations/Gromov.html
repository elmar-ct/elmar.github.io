	<h2> Dawn of Space </h2>

    <p> ur Euclidean intuition, probably inherited from ancient primates, might
have grown out of the first seeds of geometry in the motor control 
systems of early animals who were brought up to sea and then to land by the Cambrian explosion half a billion years ago. The primates' brain had been
idling for 30-40 million years. Suddenly, in a flash of one million years, it exploded into growth under the relentless pressure of sexual-social  competition and sprouted a massive neocortex (70% neurons in humans) with an
inexplicable capability for language, sequential reasoning and generation of
mathematical ideas. Then Man came and laid down space on papyrus in a string of axioms, lemmas and theorems around 300 B.C. in Alexandria.  </p>

    <p> Projected to words, the brain's model of space began to evolve by 
dropping, modifying and generalizing its axioms. The Parallel Postulate fell
first: Gauss, Schweikart, Lobachevski,1 Bolyai (who else?) came to the
conclusion that there is a unique non-trivial one-parameter deformation of
the metric </p>
