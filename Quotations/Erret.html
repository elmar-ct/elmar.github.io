	<h2> Constructivist Manifesto </h2>
	<h3> The descriptive basis of mathematics </h3>
	<p> Mathematics is that portion of our intellectual activity which 
transcends our biology and our environment. The principles of biology as we
know them may apply to life forms on other worlds, yet there is no necessity for this to be so. The principles of physics should be more
universal, yet it is easy to imagine another universe governed by 
different physical laws. Mathematics, a creation of mind, is less arbitrary
than biology or physics, creations of nature; the creatures we imagine inhabiting another world in another universe, with another biology
and another physics, will develop a mathematics which in essence is the same as ours. In believing this we may be falling into a trap: 
Mathematics being a creation of our mind, it is, of course, difficult to imagine
how mathematics could be otherwise without actually making it so, but perhaps we should not presume to predict the course of the  mathematical activities of all possible types of intelligence..
On the other
hand, the pragmatic content of our belief in the transcendence of
mathematics has nothing to do with alien forms of life. Rather it serves to give a direction to mathematical investigation, resulting from the
insistence that mathematics be born of an inner necessity.
	
	</p> 

	<p> 
		The primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means
the positive integers. We feel about number the way Kant felt about
space. The positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed by the
very nature of our intelligence and, we are tempted to believe, by the
very nature of intelligence in general. The development of the theory
of the positive integers from the primitive concept of the unit, the
concept of adjoining a unit, and the process of mathematical induction
carries complete conviction. In the words of Kronecker, the positive
integers were created by God. Kronecker would have expressed it even
better if he had said that the positive integers were created by God for
the benefit of man (and other finite beings). Mathematics belongs to
man, not to God. We are not interested in properties of the positive
integers that have no descriptive meaning for finite man. When a man
proves a positive integer to exist, he should show how to find it. If
God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done, let him do it
himself.
	
	</p>

		<p>
			Almost equal in importance to number are the constructions by which
we ascend from number to the higher levels of mathematical existence.
These constructions involve the discovery of relationships among
mathematical entities already constructed, in the process of which
new mathematical entities are created. The relations which form the
point of departure are the order and arithmetical relations of the
positive integers. From these we construct various rules for pairing
integers with one another, for separating out certain integers from the
rest, and for associating one integer to another. Rules of this sort give
rise to the notions of sets and functions.
			
		</p>

	<p>
		A set is not an entity which has an ideal existence. A set exists only
when it has been defined. To define a set we prescribe, at least implicitly,
what we (the constructing intelligence) must do in order to construct
an element of the set, and what we must do to show that two elements
of the set are equal. A similar remark applies to the definition of a
function: in order to define a function from a set \(A\) to a set \(B\), we
prescribe a finite routine which leads from an element of \(A\) to an element
of \(B\), and show that equal elements of \(A\) give rise to equal elements of \(B\).
	</p>

	<p>
		Building on the positive integers, weaving a web of ever more sets
and more functions, we get the basic structures of mathematics: the
rational number system, the real number system, the euclidean spaces,
the complex number system, the algebraic number fields, Hubert space,
the classical groups, and so forth. Within the framework of these
structures most mathematics is done. Everything attaches itself to number, and every mathematical statement ultimately expresses the
fact that if we perform certain computations within the set of positive
integers, we shall get certain results.
	</p>

		<p>
			Mathematics takes another leap, from the entity which is 
constructed in fact to the entity whose construction is hypothetical. To
some extent hypothetical entities are present from the start: whenever
we assert that every positive integer has a certain property, in essence
we are considering a positive integer whose construction is hypothetical.
But now we become bolder and consider a hypothetical set, endowed
with hypothetical operations subject to certain axioms. In this way
we introduce such structures as topological spaces, groups, and 
manifolds. The motivation for doing this comes from the study of concretely
constructed examples, and the justification comes from the possibility
of applying the theory of the hypothetical structure to the study of
more than one specific example. Recently it has become fashionable
to take another leap and study, as it were, a hypothetical hypothetical
structure—a hypothetical structure qua hypothetical structure. Again
the motivations and justifications attach themselves to particular
examples, and the examples attach themselves to numbers in the
ultimate analysis. Thus even the most abstract mathematical 
statement has a computational basis.
		</p>

	<p>
		The transcendence of mathematics demands that it should not be
confined to computations that I can perform, or you can perform, or
\(100\) men working \(100\) years with 100 digital computers can perform.
Any computation that can be performed by a finite intelligence—any
computation that has a finite number of steps—is permissible. This does
not mean that no value is to be placed on the efficiency of a 
computation. An applied mathematician will prize a computation for its 
efficiency above all else, whereas in formal mathematics much attention
is paid to elegance and little to efficiency. Mathematics should and must
concern itself with efficiency, perhaps to the detriment of elegance, but
these matters will come to the fore only when realism has begun to
prevail. Until then our first concern will be to put as much mathematics
as possible on a realistic basis without close attention to questions of
efficiency.
	</p>

		<h3> Idealistic components of mathematics</h3

	<p> 
		Geometry was highly idealistic from the time of Euclid and the ancients
until the time of Descartes, unfolding from axioms taken either to be
self-evident or to reflect properties of the real world. Descartes reduced
geometry to the theory of the real numbers, and in the nineteenth century Dedekind, Weierstrass, and others, by the arithmetization of
the real number system, brought space into the concrete realm of
objects constructed by pure thought.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately the promise held out to mathematics by the 
arithmetization of space was not fulfilled, largely due to the intervention,
around the turn of the century, of the formalist program. The 
successful formalization of mathematics helped keep mathematics on a
wrong course. The fact that space has been arithmetized loses much of
its significance if space, number, and everything else are fitted into a
matrix of idealism where even the positive integers have an ambiguous
computational existence. Mathematics becomes the game of sets, which
is a fine game as far as it goes, with rules that are admirably precise.
The game becomes its own justification, and the fact that it represents
a highly idealized version of mathematical existence is universally
ignored.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, idealistic tendencies have been present if not dominant
in mathematics since the Greeks, but it took the full flowering of
formalism to kill the insight into the nature of mathematics which its
arithmetization could have given.
	</p>

	<p>
		To see how some of the most basic results of classical analysis lack
computational meaning, take the assertion that every bounded non-
void set \(A\) of real numbers has a least upper bound. (The real number
\(b\) is the least upper bound of \(A\) if \(a \leqslant b\) for all \(a\) in \(A\) and if there exist
elements of \(A\) that are arbitrarily close to\(b\).) To avoid unnecessary
complications, we actually consider the somewhat less general assertion
that every bounded sequence \(\{ x_k\} \) of rational numbers has a least
upper bound b (in the set of real numbers). If this assertion were 
constructively valid, we could compute \(b\), in the sense of computing a
rational number approximating \(b\) to within any desired accuracy; in
fact we could program a digital computer to compute the 
approximations for us. For instance, the computer could be programmed to a sequence \(\{(b_k,m_k)\}\) of ordered pairs, where each
\(b_k\) is a rational number and each nik is a positive integer, such that (i) \(x_j \leqslant b_k + k^{-1}\) for all positive integers \(j\) and \(k\), 
		and (ii) \(x_{m_k} \geqslant b_k - k^{-1}\) for all positive integers \(k\). Unless there exists a general method \(Μ\) that
produces such a computer program corresponding to each bounded
constructively given sequence \(\{x_k\} \) of rational numbers, we are not
justified, by constructive standards, in asserting that each of the
sequences \( \{x_k\} \) has a least upper bound. To see the scope such a method
\(Μ\) would have, consider a constructively given sequence \(\{n_k\}\) of
integers, each of which is either \(0\) or \(1\).
	</p>

	<p>
		Using the method \(M\), we compute
a rational number \(b_3\) and a positive integer \(N \equiv m_3\) such that (i)
		\(n_j \leqslant b_3 + \frac{1}{3} \) for all positive integers \(j\). If \(n_N = 0\), then (i) and (ii) imply that 
		<math>
			n_j \leqslant b_3 + \frac{1}{3} \leqslant n_N + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
		</math>
