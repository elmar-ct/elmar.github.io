	<h2> Constructive Analysis Manifesto </h2>
	<h3> The descriptive basis of mathematics </h3>
	<p> Mathematics is that portion of our intellectual activity which 
transcends our biology and our environment. The principles of biology as we
know them may apply to life forms on other worlds, yet there is no necessity for this to be so. The principles of physics should be more
universal, yet it is easy to imagine another universe governed by 
different physical laws. Mathematics, a creation of mind, is less arbitrary
than biology or physics, creations of nature; the creatures we imagine inhabiting another world in another universe, with another biology
and another physics, will develop a mathematics which in essence is the same as ours. In believing this we may be falling into a trap: 
Mathematics being a creation of our mind, it is, of course, difficult to imagine
how mathematics could be otherwise without actually making it so, but perhaps we should not presume to predict the course of the  mathematical activities of all possible types of intelligence..
On the other
hand, the pragmatic content of our belief in the transcendence of
mathematics has nothing to do with alien forms of life. Rather it serves to give a direction to mathematical investigation, resulting from the
insistence that mathematics be born of an inner necessity.

		The primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means
the positive integers. We feel about number the way Kant felt about
space. The positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed by the
very nature of our intelligence and, we are tempted to believe, by the
very nature of intelligence in general. The development of the theory
of the positive integers from the primitive concept of the unit, the
concept of adjoining a unit, and the process of mathematical induction
carries complete conviction. In the words of Kronecker, the positive
integers were created by God. Kronecker would have expressed it even
better if he had said that the positive integers were created by God for
the benefit of man (and other finite beings). Mathematics belongs to
man, not to God. We are not interested in properties of the positive
integers that have no descriptive meaning for finite man. When a man
proves a positive integer to exist, he should show how to find it. If
God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done, let him do it
himself.

			Almost equal in importance to number are the constructions by which
we ascend from number to the higher levels of mathematical existence.
These constructions involve the discovery of relationships among
mathematical entities already constructed, in the process of which
new mathematical entities are created. The relations which form the
point of departure are the order and arithmetical relations of the
positive integers. From these we construct various rules for pairing
integers with one another, for separating out certain integers from the
rest, and for associating one integer to another. Rules of this sort give
rise to the notions of sets and functions.
			
		</p>

	<p>
		A set is not an entity which has an ideal existence. A set exists only
when it has been defined. To define a set we prescribe, at least implicitly,
what we (the constructing intelligence) must do in order to construct
an element of the set, and what we must do to show that two elements
of the set are equal. A similar remark applies to the definition of a
function: in order to define a function from a set A to a set B, we
prescribe a finite routine which leads from an element of A to an element
of Б, and show that equal elements of A give rise to equal elements of B.
