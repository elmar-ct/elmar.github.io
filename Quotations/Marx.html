	<h2> Quotations from Karl Marx </h2>
    
	<p> The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking that is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question. (Theses of Feuerbach) </p> <br>
    
   <p> The highest point reached by contemplative materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, 
     is contemplation of single individuals and of civil society. </p> (Theses of Feuerbach) <br>
    
   <p> The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the standpoint of the new is human society, or social humanity.(Theses of Feuerbach)</p><br>
    
    <p> The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.(Theses of Feuerbach)</p><br>

	<h3> Idealism and Materialism(German Ideology) </h3>

	<p> In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we
ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to
arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of
this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to
material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their
corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material
production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but
consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the
real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.
