	<h2> Quotations from Karl Marx </h2>
    
	<p> The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking that is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question. (Theses of Feuerbach) </p> <br>
    
   <p> The highest point reached by contemplative materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, 
     is contemplation of single individuals and of civil society. </p> (Theses of Feuerbach) <br>
    
   <p> The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the standpoint of the new is human society, or social humanity.(Theses of Feuerbach)</p><br>
    
    <p> The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.(Theses of Feuerbach)</p><br>
