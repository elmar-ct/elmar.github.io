<h2> Basic Concepts </h2>

<p>On a set \(X\) is defined a topology if there is a class of its subsets that is (the class) stable under any union and any finite intersection. The sets in 
the given class are called open sets. As usual, two immediate topology come in mind: the trivial topology consisting of only two open sets, and the discrete 
topology with all subsets of \(X\) being open sets.</p>

<p> The most fundamental concept in topology is undoubtedly the concept of <em>neighborhood</em> which provides the precise setting for what we ordinarily call <q> near to...</q>.
The neighborhood of a point in a topological space is any open set containing that point. Other concepts include:

<ul>
	<li> <b>Interior</b>. The interior (part) of \(A\), \(Int(A)\) or \(Int_X(A)\) is the largest among the open sets contained in \(A\):
	
	\( Int(A) = \cup_{\mathcal{O}\, \text{open},\mathcal{O}\subset A} \mathcal{O}  \)
	</li> <br>

	<li> <b> Closure </b>. The closure  of \(A\), denoted by \(Cl(A)\), is the smallest among the closed sets containing \(A\), i.e. the intersection of all closed sets containing \(A\) or the 
	closed set generated  by \(A\);</li> <br>

	<li>  For all \(A\): \( Int(A) \subset A \subset Cl(A) ;\) </li>

	<li> <b> Boundary</b>. \( Fr A = \partial A = Cl(A) \setminus Int(A); \)  </li>

	<li> The point in \( Int(A) \), \( Cl(A) \), \(Fr(A)\), and \( X \setminus Cl(A) = Int(X\setminus A)  \) are called <em>interior </em> , 
		<em>adherent</em>, <em>boundary </em> and <em> exterior </em> point respectively; </li>
	<li> A point is interior to \(A\) if there is an open set containing that point and entirely contained in \(A\): \(x \to Int(A)\) if there exists \(\mathcal{O}\)
	open set such that \(\mathcal{O}\) is a part of \(A\) and \(x\to \mathcal{O}\). (Notion of parts and containment are categorical.)</li>
	<li> A point is adherent to \(A\)  if any arbitrary of its neighborhood intersects \(A\): \(x\to Cl(A)\) if for any open set \(\mathcal{O}\) containing \(x\),  there exists
		\( x\neq y \to \mathcal{O}\cap A \);
	</li>
	<li> A point is boundary point to \(A\) if any arbitrary of its neighborhoods intersects both \(A\) and \( X\setminus A \); and finally </li>
	<li> A point is exterior point to \(A\) if it has a neighborhood that does not intersect \(A\). </li> <br>
	<li> <b> Everywhere dense</b>. A subset \(A\) of \(X\) is everywhere dense in the top space \(X\) if \(A\) intersects any nonempty open set in \(X\), i.e. if 
		its closure is the whole space \(X\). A nowhere dense subset is a subset whole complement is everywhere dense. Subsets of \(X\) can be classified according to 
		whether they are countable union of nowhere dense  subsets. Any subset that is so is of the first category; any other is of the second category. In a complete
		metric space, the so-called Baire category theorem (BCT) states thatif \(A\subset X\) is of first category, then \(X\setminus A\) is everywhere dense, that is of the second category.
